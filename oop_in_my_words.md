#### Why OOP?
* Easier to maintain due to OOPs modular design of seperating data into containers and sectioning on pieces of code that substitues interaction over dependencies.
* Since code is modular it makes it easier to maintain and less fragile when changes are needed.
* Code can easily be extended making it much easier to implement new features.
* Code is reusable allowing the programmer to follow the DRY principle of not repeating snippets of code unecessarily resulting in faster development. 


#### How does Ruby implement OOP?
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation

> Ruby uses abstraction to implement encapsulation. Ruby uses Inheritance to implement polymorphism.

Encapsulation and Polymorphism is how ruby allows us to create containers for data that could be changed/manipulated without affecting the entire program.  Its also how we can section off areas of code that can perform certain procedures so that the components within the program interact rather than depend on each other.
