Using the code from the previous exercise, add a setter method named #name=. Then, rename kitty to 'Luna' and invoke #greet again.

```ruby
class Cat
  # attr_writer :name  # setter method defined using shorthand

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  #setter method defined using long hand
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end


kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name = "Luna"  #setter mehod invoked outside the class on an object.
kitty.greet
```

`setter` methods allow us to set or update the values assigned to instance variables.  

Like `getter` methods, `setter` methods can also be invoked within and outside the class.  Inside the class they must be prepended by `self` to disambiguate them from a local variable.  

By convention the `name` contains the same name as the instance variable it is `setting`

There are two ways to define a setter method.  One way is by defining the instance method which includes adding `=` to the name, and adding a parameter. However the preferred option is to invoke the `attr_writer` method which automaticaly creates the `setter` method for us.  The `attr_writer` takes in a symbol as an argument which is used to name the `setter` method.

Setter methods always return the value that is passed in as an argument. If the setter tries to return something other than the argument's value, it just ignores it.
