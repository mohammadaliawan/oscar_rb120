Using the code from the previous exercise, replace the getter and setter methods using Ruby shorthand

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name = 'Luna'
kitty.greet
```

As previously stated, a `getter` method allow us to `get` or `retrieve` a value assigned to an instance variable, while a `setter` method allows us to `set` or `update` the value assigned to an instance variable.

Because creating `getter` and `setter` methods is so common, Ruby has a built in method that creates both methods for us. The `attr_accessor` takes in a symbol as an argument and uses it as the name for the `getter` and `setter` methods.
