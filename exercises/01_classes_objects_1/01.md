Update the following code so that, instead of printing the values, each statement prints the name of the class to which it belongs.

```ruby
puts "Hello".class
puts 5.class
puts [1, 2, 3].class 
```

In ruby everything that can be said to have a value is an object therefore all values in this example are objects. To find the class of an object simply invoke the `#class` method on that object.
