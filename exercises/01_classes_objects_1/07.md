Using the code from the previous exercise, add a getter method named #name and invoke it in place of @name in #greet

```ruby
class Cat  
  # attr_reader :name  # shorthand for defining getter method. 

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # long hand for defining getter method
  def name
    @name
  end  
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"  #example of using getter inside the class.
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name # example of using getter outside the class
```

`getter methods` allow us to access the values of `instance variables` and can be invoke invoked both inside and outside the class.

`getter methods` are just like regular `instance methods`, except that by convention they are labeled the same `name` as the `instance variable` they encapsulate. 

`getter methods` can be written out manually using the full method definition syntax, however the preferred option is to use the shorthand version using the attribute reader syntax `attr_reader :symbol`
