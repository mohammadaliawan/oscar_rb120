Using the code from the previous exercise, add a getter method named #name and invoke it in place of @name in #greet

```ruby
class Cat  
  attr_reader :name  # shorthand for defining getter method and preferred way.

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # long hand for defining getter method
  # def name
    # @name
  # end  
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"  #example of using getter inside the class.
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name # example of using getter outside the class
```

`getter` method allow us to access the value assigned to an instance variable. By convention a `getter` method's name should match the name of the instance variable it exposes.

A `getter` method can be created in one of two ways.  One option is by writing out the full method definition ourselves.  However the preferred option is to invoke the `attr_reader` method which automaticaly creates the `getter` method for us.  The `attr_reader` takes in a symbol as an argument which is used to name the `getter` method.

Additional Info:

Like other instance methods, `getter` methods are `public` by default.  This means that they can be accessed inside a class, as well as outside the class via the object.
