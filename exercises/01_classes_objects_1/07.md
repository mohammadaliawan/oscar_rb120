Using the code from the previous exercise, add a getter method named #name and invoke it in place of @name in #greet

```ruby
class Cat  
  attr_reader :name  # shorthand for defining getter method and preferred way.

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # long hand for defining getter method
  # def name
    # @name
  # end  
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"  #example of using getter inside the class.
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.name # example of using getter outside the class
```

`getter` methods allow us to access and return the values assigned to instance variables and can be invoked both inside and outside the class.

A `getter` method is an instance method that by convention has the same name as the instance variable it exposes.

A `getter` method can be created in one of two ways.  One option is by writing out the full method definition ourselves.  However the preferred option is to invoke the `attr_reader` method which automaticaly creates the `getter` method for us.  The `attr_reader` takes in a symbol as an argument and uses it as the name for the `getter` method.
