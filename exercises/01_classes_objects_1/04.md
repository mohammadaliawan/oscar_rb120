Using the code from the previous exercise, add an #initialize method that prints I'm a cat! when a new Cat object is initialized.

```ruby
  class Cat
    def initialize
      puts "I'm a cat!"
    end
  end

  kitty = Cat::new
```

To add an `initialize` method to a class, we start by defining it using the reserved word `def` followed by the `name` of the method definition using the `snake_case` naming convention before ending the method definition with the reserved word `end`.

When defining a class we usually define an initialize method (also known as a constructor). This allows us to set up newly initialized objects for immediate immediate use as the initialized method gets called/triggered everytime we initialize a new object.
