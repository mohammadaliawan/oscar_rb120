Using the code from the previous exercise, add an #initialize method that prints I'm a cat! when a new Cat object is initialized.

```ruby
  class Cat
    def initialize
      puts "I'm a cat!"
    end
  end

  kitty = Cat::new
```

To add an `initialize` method to a class, we start by defining it using the reserved word `def` followed by the `name` of the method definition using the `snake_case` naming convention before ending the method definition with the reserved word `end`.

When defining a class we usually define an initialize method also known as a constructor which is called or triggered evertime we initialize a new object.  This allows us to set initial value(s) for attributes of an object so that it's available for immediate use.
