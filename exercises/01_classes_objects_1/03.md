Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.

```ruby
  class Cat
  end

  kitty = Cat.new
``` 
To instantiate a new `Cat` object we invoke the ::new class method on class `Cat` which returns an instance of the class.  We then initialize the local variable `kitty` to the return value of `Cat.new`. The local variable `kitty` now points to the object returned by `Cat.new`.
