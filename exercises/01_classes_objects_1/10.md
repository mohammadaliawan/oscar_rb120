Using the following code, create a module named Walkable that contains a method named #walk. This method should print Let's go for a walk! when invoked. Include Walkable in Cat and invoke #walk on kitty.

```ruby
module Walkable
  def walk
    puts "Let's go for a walk!"
  end
end

class Cat
  include Walkable
  
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
kitty.walk
```

Modules are containers for methods that are useful for multiple classes but not all classes. You mix in a module into a class using the `include` method invocation.  This lets us invoke the methods contained in the module on any instance (object) of the class that includes that module.
