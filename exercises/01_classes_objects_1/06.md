Using the code from the previous exercise, move the greeting from the #initialize method to an instance method named #greet that prints a greeting when invoked.

```ruby
class Cat
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello! My name is #{@name}!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.greet
```
Because `instance variables` are scoped at the object level, once an object has been `initialized`, they can be referenced anywhere within the object so long as the object exists.

This allows us to move the statement that outputs "Hello! My name is Sophie!" from within `#initialize` method to a new instance method `greet`.  Because `instance methods` are public methods by default, we can invoke `greet` on any object of the class `Cat`
