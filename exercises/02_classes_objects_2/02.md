Using the following code, add an instance method named #rename that renames kitty when invoked.

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_accessor :name, :rename

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def rename(new_name)
    self.name = new_name
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
kitty.name
kitty.rename('Chloe')
kitty.name
```

The reserved word `self` is a way of being explicity about what our program is referencing and what our intentions are as far as behavior.

`self` refers to the calling object:

1. Inside a class and inside an instance method `self` refers to the instance of the class that called the method - the calling object.
2. Inside a class and outside an instance method `self` refers to the class itself an can be used to define a class method.

When invoking setter methods from within the class, they must be denoted with the reserved word `self`.  This allows ruby to differentiate between initializing a local variable and invoking a setter method.

In this example, within the `rename` instance method, we prepend `self` in front of `name`. This lets Ruby know that we are invoking the `setter` method `name` on the class instance that `kitty` points to.
