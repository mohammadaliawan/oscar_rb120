Using the following code, add a method named #identify that returns its calling object.

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def identify
    self
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')
p kitty.identify # returns #<Cat:0x000055d2b7735570 @name="Sophie">
p kitty     # also returns #<Cat:0x000055d2b7735570 @name="Sophie">
```

The reserved word `self` is a way of being explicity about what our program is referencing and what our intentions are as far as behavior.

`self` refers to the calling object:

1. Inside a class and inside an instance method `self` refers to the instance of the class that called the method - the calling object.
2. Inside a class and outside an instance method `self` refers to the class itself an can be used to define a class method.

In this example, invoking `self` is the same as invoking kitty as they both return the calling object `#<Cat:0x000055d2b7735570 @name="Sophie">`
