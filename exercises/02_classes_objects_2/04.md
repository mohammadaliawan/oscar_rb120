Using the following code, add two methods: ::generic_greeting and #personal_greeting. The first method should be a class method and print a greeting that's generic to the class. The second method should be an instance method and print a greeting that's custom to the object.

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_reader :name
  
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end  
  
  def self.generic_greeting
    puts "Hello! I'm a #{self}!" # `self` refers to the class `Cat`
  end

  def personal_greeting
    puts "Hello! My name is #{self.name}!" # `self` refers to the object that kitty points to
  end
  
end

kitty = Cat.new('Sophie')

Cat.generic_greeting
kitty.personal_greeting
```

Class methods is where we put functionality that does not pertain to individual objects, in other words the unique state of the object.
    
Class methods differ from instance methods in that class methods belong to class and not an instance of the class. We do not have to instantiate an object to use class methods.  Within class methods we are restricted from adding data specific to the object of the class.
  
Instance methods are scoped at the object level and allow us to set or expose information about the object. When `self` is used within the instance method, it refers to the instance of the class.  This allows us to invoke the instance methods on the object that self references.
