Modify the following code so that Hello! I'm a cat! is printed when Cat.generic_greeting is invoked.

```ruby
class Cat
  def self.generic_greeting
    puts "Hello! I'm a cat!"
  end
end

Cat.generic_greeting
```

The reserved word `self` is a way of being explicity about what our program is referencing and what our intentions are as far as behavior.

`self` refers to the calling object:

1. Inside a class and inside an instance method `self` refers to the instance of the class that called the method - the calling object.
2. Inside a class and outside an instance method `self` refers to the class itself an can be used to define a class method.

We use `class` methods when we need functionality that does not pertain to individual objects of the class. 

`class` methods are defined using the reserved word `self` followed by the name of the method using the  `snake_case` naming convention.

In this example, `self` in `self.generic_greeting` therefore refers to the class `Cat` and its used to define the class method `generic_greeting`.
