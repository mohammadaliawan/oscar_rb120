# 1. How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an object.
# In ruby, an object is created by first defining attributes and behaviors
# in a class and calling an instance of that class using the class method `new`.

# x01.rb
class MyClass
   # some methods and instance variables defined
end

object_one = MyClass.new
p object_one
