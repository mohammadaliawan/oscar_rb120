##### What is OOP and why is it important?

OOP is a programming paradigm that was created to help deal with the growing complexities of large software systems.  As programs grow in size and complexity they become harder to maintain. This is because making a change in one area of the program, affects other areas due to dependencies within the program. 

By implementing the concepts of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation, OOP allows the programmer to design more modular, extendable, and reusable code that is easier to maintain, and less fragile.

The software system becomes a type of messaging system by removing dependencies and replacing them with the interaction between components.

* Easier to maintain due to OOPs modular design of seperating data into containers and sectioning on pieces of code that substitues interaction over dependencies.
* Since code is modular it makes it easier to maintain and less fragile when changes are needed.
* Code can easily be extended making it much easier to implement new features.
* Code is reusable allowing the programmer to follow the DRY principle of not repeating snippets of code unecessarily resulting in faster development.
